bio/yap page you dont have to read it all to interact

moved some of the more basic info to my strawpage :P

im not very energetic or great at talking to people and might come off as "dry" or disinterested sorry . im homeschooled and kinda taught myself to write so please dont correct my spelling errors unless you actually cant understand me 

c+h is fine unless im with a friend . im offtab or semi afk a lot so whisper me if im not replying .
i like messing with colors and often use filters to edit my ponies so my style might vary a lot . dont copy me

i have some ponies for fandoms that im kinda scared interacting with / wouldnt really count myself as being in (mha, rblx, mcyt, hoyoverse) so please iwc if youre in those fandoms

i block and hide people freely but itll only be temporary unless your REALLY weird

proshippers dni please (im not an "anti" or whatever btw i think dark topics in fiction are fine the issue is romanticizing it)
