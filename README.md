bio/yap page you dont have to read it all to interact

hi im bullet/hal/whatever you want to call me i dont really care . he/him only unless we are close

i like comics (DC , marvel , & TUA) , horror in general , and a lot of music (NIN & MCR are my favs though) , im also getting into limbus company but im only at the start of canto 2 so dont expect me to know a lot

im not very energetic or great at talking to people and might come off as "dry" or disinterested sorry

c+h is fine unless im with a friend . im offtab or semi afk a lot so whisper me if im not replying .
i like messing with colors and often use filters to edit my ponies so my style might vary a lot . dont copy me

i block and hide people freely but itll only be temporary unless your REALLY weird
