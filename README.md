bio/yap page you dont have to read it all to interact idc

hi im bullet/hal/whatever you want to call me i dont really care . any pronouns technically but he/him is perferred unless we are close

fictkin of a lot of characters and also maybe otherkin

i like comics (DC , marvel , & TUA) , roblox (fandom iwc a lot of yall are freaky) , ultrakill , 8:11 , horror in general , and a lot of music (NIN is my favorite though)

im not very energetic or great at talking to people and might come off as "dry" or disinterested sorry

my wifi is really bad so i might disconnect and rejoin a lot . c+h is fine unless im with a friend . im offtab or semi afk a lot so whisper me if im not replying .
i like messing with colors and often use filters to edit my ponies so my style might vary a lot DO NOT COPY ME

i block and hide people freely but itll only be temporary unless your REALLY weird

i sometimes unadd people without warning if we dont talk a lot its nothing personal i just like keeping my friends lists short you can totally add me back if you want to talk again
