bio/yap page you dont have to read it all to interact idc

hi im bullet/hal/whatever you want to call me i dont really care . any pronouns technically but he/it/they is perferred unless we are close

fictkin of a lot of characters and also maybe otherkin

i like comics (DC , marvel , & TUA) , roblox , ultrakill , 8:11 , horror in general , and a lot of music (NIN is my favorite though)

im not very energetic or great at talking to people and might come off as "dry" or disinterested sorry

c+h is fine unless im with a friend . im offtab or semi afk a lot so whisper me if im not replying

i like messing with colors and often use filters to edit my ponies so my style might vary a lot DO NOT COPY ME

not exactly a DNI list cause ik thats not stopping anyone but reasons i might have blocked/hid someone : basic stuff(racist , homophobic etc) , using the r slur , making weird jokes in public chats , TCC/zeroday fans , hardcore HH/HB fans , anti furry/therian/otherkin , harrassing anyone for any reason (i dont like proships either but bothering some traumatized kid isnt gonna make it any better) , generative AI users (includes chatbots like c.ai btw)

i sometimes unadd people without warning if we dont talk a lot its nothing personal i just like keeping my friends lists short you can totally add me back if you want to talk again
